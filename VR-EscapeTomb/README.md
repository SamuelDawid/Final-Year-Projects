# VR-EscapeTomb

A virtual reality escape room game built in Unity featuring immersive hand tracking, physics-based interactions, and puzzle-solving gameplay set in an ancient tomb environment.

## üéÆ Game Overview

VR-EscapeTomb is an immersive VR experience where players must navigate through an ancient tomb, solve intricate puzzles, collect mystical papyrus pieces, and escape before time runs out. The game emphasizes realistic hand interactions and physics-based gameplay without relying on pre-built interaction toolkits.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üß© Complex Puzzle Systems
- **Multi-Stage Quest System**: 6 interconnected quests with progressive difficulty
- **Papyrus Collection**: Gather ancient scrolls to unlock new areas
- **Object Placement Puzzles**: Strategic positioning of mystical artifacts
- **Environmental Interactions**: Doors, teleportation points, and hidden areas

### üéØ Game Mechanics
- **Quest Management**: Dynamic quest tracking and completion system
- **Object Respawn System**: Lost items automatically return after timeout
- **Progressive Unlocking**: Areas and abilities unlock as quests are completed
- **Audio Integration**: Immersive sound design with volume controls

### üèõÔ∏è Immersive Environment

- **Teleportation System**: Smooth movement between areas

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Systems

**Hand Tracking (`HandController.cs`)**
- XR input device integration
- Grip strength detection (0.6f grab threshold, 0.8f release threshold)
- Physics-based joint connections for object manipulation
- Collision detection with LayerMask filtering

**Physics Management (`HandTrackingPhysics.cs`)**
- Rigidbody-based hand movement
- Continuous collision detection
- Angular velocity calculations for realistic rotation
- Fixed joint systems for stable object holding

**Game State Management (`GameManager.cs`)**
- Singleton pattern for global state access
- Quest progression tracking
- Dynamic object activation/deactivation
- Player position management and respawn system

**Quest System (`QuestManager.cs`)**
- Array-based quest tracking with string identifiers
- Integration with puzzle completion states
- Progressive unlocking of game areas
- Support for complex multi-part quests

## üéØ Gameplay Flow

1. **Starting Area**: Players begin in the entrance chamber
2. **Quest 1-3**: Collect mystical objects (snake, bowl, feather) to open first door
3. **Second Chamber**: Solve environmental puzzles to access teleportation
4. **Papyrus Hunt**: Locate and collect three ancient papyrus pieces
5. **Final Chamber**: Complete remaining puzzles to unlock the exit
6. **Escape**: Navigate through the final passage to complete the game

## üîß Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2020.3 LTS or later
- VR headset (Oculus, SteamVR compatible)
- XR Management package
- XR Interaction Toolkit (for basic XR setup only)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VR-EscapeTomb.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity
3. Configure XR settings for your target headset
4. Build and deploy to your VR device

### Controls
- **Grip**: Squeeze grip button to grab objects
- **Release**: Release grip button when grip strength < 80%
- **Movement**: Use teleportation points throughout the tomb
- **Interaction**: Physical contact with hands for all interactions



## üéÆ Design Philosophy

**No Toolkit Dependency**: All interaction mechanics are built from scratch using Unity's core physics system, ensuring full control over the player experience.

**Physics-First Approach**: Every interaction relies on realistic physics simulation, creating an intuitive and immersive VR experience.

**Progressive Complexity**: Puzzles increase in difficulty, introducing new mechanics gradually to maintain player engagement.

**Accessibility**: Volume controls and testing modes ensure the game is accessible to different player preferences.

## üêõ Known Issues & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Hand collision sometimes requires precise positioning
- Object respawn timer could be more dynamic
- Limited to single-player experience

### Planned Features
- Multiplayer cooperation mode
- Additional puzzle types
- Enhanced haptic feedback
- Mobile VR support
