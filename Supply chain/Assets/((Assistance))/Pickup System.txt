For the object that you want to pick up...

1) Change layer to 'GrabbableObjects'
2) Attach rigidbody component
3) Add script 'Key Item' to it. It's serialized parameters:

	- Launch Speed:	 How fast you grab the object, and how fast and far it goes when released (around 10 - 15, depends on experience)
	- is Rotatable:	 If you can rotate it (uses the X, Y, Z keys; can change controls through the 'GlobalScript' script (you'll see it at the top))
	- Rotate Speed:  Rotation Speed (Around 3, but again preference)
	- Info KID:
		
		1) Go into: 'Prefabs' > 'Models' > 'Key Items (100 - 199)
		
			(If you want, look at the 'Gear' key item as an example of how to set up a key item)

		2) Create a new folder, name it the key item's name. Within, store the object as a prefab

		3) Right Click > 'Create' > 'Items' > 'Crafting Materials' to create a scriptable object of crafting materials

		4) (Important) IDs are in order of folder creation. Set the ID field to the number that's after the ID number in the folder before the one you created. 
		   (e.g. 1st folder? Set ID to 100; 2nd folder? Set ID to 101)

		5) Fill in all of the fields (Name, Prefab (NOT FBX) of object, sprite of image, etc)

		6) Put the created scriptable object as 'info KID'

	- Key Item Type Sprite: Add the 'Key Icon' Sprite

4) In the Hierarchy in the 'Final Gameplay' scene, go to '{LIST} Systems, Holders, etc' > '--> Item Registration Holder'. 

5) You'll see the 'Item Registration' Script. Under 'Key Items', put the created script object within the list

6) Go into 'Assets' > 'Prefabs' > 'UI' > 'Gameplay' > 'Identifications' > '[Tmpt] Key Item Identification' and put the Key Item Identification Template
prefab as a child of the game object that you want to pick up

---> TOPIC: KEY ITEM PICKUP ISSUES

In the event that picking up key items doesn't work properly or at all, please try either of these:

1)

- (HIERARCHY) '{LIST} Elements' > 'Player' > '[Camera] Player'
- (INSPECTOR) 'Pickup System (Script)' > 'Ray Distance': Modify the ray distance (ideally between 3 - 10, but if higher works then that's fine)

2) 

- Modify the key item's Launch Speed parameter: Make launch speed higher (differs upon object type)
