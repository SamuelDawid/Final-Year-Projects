---> TOPIC: Key items, Weapons, & Crafting Materials

Weapons: Stored within the 'Weapons' folder
Key Items: Stored within the 'Key Items' folder
Crafting Materials: Stored within the 'Crafting Materials' folder

(How to create)

To create either one: 

- Right Click > Create > Items > {Select which one you want to create. It creates a scriptable object in which you need to fill out all of the fields}

(IDs)

- Key Item IDs range from 100 - 199
- Weapon IDs range from 200 - 299
- Crafting Material IDs range from 300 - 399

(It's highly recommended to create a scriptable object for each of these)
